# Detecting Persistence on Windows Computers for Non-Technical Users

**Introduction**

Cybersecurity threats are constantly evolving, and one of the ways attackers maintain access to a compromised system is through persistence mechanisms. These mechanisms allow malicious software to survive reboots and remain active on your computer. For a Windows user with low technical ability, detecting these persistence methods can be challenging but not impossible. In this comprehensive guide, we'll explore some common signs of persistence and how you can spot them, including watching for Command Prompt windows at startup, identifying persistence in the Windows Registry, and looking for indicators of persistence in PowerShell, cmd, rundll32, and wmic attached commands.

**Signs of Persistence**

1. **Cmd Windows Loading at Startup**: One of the most obvious signs of persistence is the appearance of Command Prompt (cmd) windows when you start your computer. These windows may flash briefly or remain open, indicating that a script or command is running in the background.

2. **Unexplained Network Activity**: If you notice unusual network activity on your computer, such as data being sent or received when you're not actively using the internet, it could be a sign of persistent malware communicating with its command and control server.

3. **Slow Performance**: Persistent malware can consume system resources, leading to slower performance. If your computer suddenly becomes sluggish without any apparent reason, it's worth investigating further.

4. **Unexpected Software Installations**: If you see unfamiliar software installed on your computer, especially ones you didn't install yourself, it could be a sign of malicious software using persistence to maintain a presence on your system.

5. **Changes to System Settings**: Malicious software often makes changes to system settings to ensure its persistence. These changes may include adding new startup entries, modifying registry keys, or altering file permissions.

**Spotting Persistence in the Registry**

The Windows Registry is a database that stores low-level settings for the operating system and for applications that opt to use the registry. Attackers often use the registry for persistence because it allows them to execute commands or launch programs automatically when the system starts. Here's how you can spot persistence in the registry:

1. **Run Registry Editor**: Press `Win + R`, type `regedit`, and press Enter to open the Registry Editor.

2. **Navigate to Startup Locations**: In the Registry Editor, navigate to the following locations:

   - HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run
   - HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnce
   - HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run
   - HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnce

   Look for suspicious entries in these locations. Malicious software often adds entries here to ensure it runs every time Windows starts.

3. **Check for Unusual Entries**: Look for entries with strange or random names, especially ones that point to executable files located in unusual directories (e.g., Temp or AppData folders).

4. **Look for Persistence Techniques**: Some common persistence techniques involve adding entries that run scripts or commands at startup. For example, an entry pointing to `cmd.exe /c <command>` could indicate a persistence mechanism.

5. **Verify Legitimate Entries**: Not all entries in the startup locations are malicious. Some legitimate software also adds entries here to start with Windows. If you're unsure, search online for the entry's name to see if it's associated with legitimate software.

**Indicators of Persistence in PowerShell, cmd, rundll32, and wmic Attached Commands**

1. **PowerShell**: Check for suspicious PowerShell commands or scripts. Malicious PowerShell commands are often encoded to evade detection. Look for base64 or other encoded commands, especially in scripts that are set to run at startup.

2. **cmd**: Similarly, look for suspicious commands in the Command Prompt. Attackers may use cmd to execute commands at startup. Check for commands that are not typical system commands and may be related to malware.

3. **rundll32**: Rundll32 is a legitimate Windows program that allows dynamic link library (DLL) files to be executed. However, attackers can misuse rundll32 to run malicious DLLs. Look for rundll32 commands that point to suspicious DLL files.

4. **wmic Attached Commands**: Wmic (Windows Management Instrumentation Command-line) is a powerful tool that attackers can misuse for persistence. Look for wmic commands that are not typical system administration commands and may be related to malware.

**Conclusion**

Detecting persistence on your Windows computer doesn't require advanced technical knowledge. By keeping an eye out for signs like cmd windows at startup, checking the Windows Registry for suspicious entries, and looking for indicators of persistence in PowerShell, cmd, rundll32, and wmic attached commands, you can protect your system from persistent malware. If you suspect your computer is infected, it's essential to seek help from a cybersecurity professional to safely remove the malware and prevent future infections.
